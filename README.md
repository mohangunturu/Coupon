# Which drivers are most likely to accept the coupons?


Data Analysis:
The initial dataset contains 12684 data points with 26 attributes. Some of the attributes are numerical, while most of the categorical.

There are 74 duplicates, these records have been removed with use of first/last starategy.

All of the unique values for each attribute has been reviewed. The correlation map created to understand the relation between the data points.

There are atleast 57% of the drivers accepted the coupons from the data given.

From the analysis, it seems lke coffe house coupons are less while comparing to others. Most of the days have recorded the temparature 80 degrees when the data has been collected.

The findings from the bar coupon analysis.

It seems like more coupons are accepted with the drivers making <=3 visits to bar compared to >3 visits

While comparing the acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to the all others, it is found that drivers are travelling alone are most likely to accept the coupon than others. And drivers with kids are accpeting very less coupons compare to all other groups.

While comparing the acceptance rate between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry, it is still evident that the same pattern repeated from the above, and occupation did not matter that was considered.

while comparing the below criterias, alone group accepted than others.
- go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed *OR*
- go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 *OR*
- go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K. 

Overall, based on this analysis, people who are alone in these specific criteria groups are more likely  to accept the coupons, and drivers with kids are less likely to accept coupons.

As an additionl step, while comparing Men vs Women groups acceptance of coupons rates are little high for men than women.

Further, I will explore the data to sub-divide all groups and anlyze based on income and other attributes, while expanding the coupon types to coffee shop etc..
